# **SAR Image Colorization – SIH 1733 (2024 Winner) 🏆**  

A deep learning-based solution for **SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) image colorization**, developed as part of **Smart India Hackathon 2024**. This project enhances SAR image visualization, making them more interpretable for researchers and analysts.  

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This project leverages **deep learning** techniques to colorize SAR images, enabling better analysis and insights. Key features include:  
- **Flask-based web interface** for easy image uploads and processing  
- **AI-powered chatbot** for assisting users with insights  
- **Pre-trained deep learning model** for SAR image colorization  

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Flask, Python  
- **AI/ML:** Deep Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch), OpenCV  
- **Database:** SQLite/MongoDB (if applicable)  
- **Deployment:** Flask-based local server

## 📂 **Getting Started**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sujal-devlife/web-interface.git
cd web-interface
```
### **2. Create a Virtual Environment**
```sh
python -m venv <env_name>
```
### 3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
**Windows:**

```sh
<env_name>\Scripts\activate
```
**Mac/Linux:**
```sh
source <env_name>/bin/activate
```
### **4. Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### **5. Run the Server**
```sh
python app.py
```
The web interface should now be accessible.


🤖 How It Works 

Upload SAR Image: Users upload grayscale SAR images through the web interface.
The deep learning model processes and colorizes the image.
